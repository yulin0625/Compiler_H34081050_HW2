# Compiler 2022 Programming Assignment II
Syntactic and Semantic Denitions for μGo

## 作業介紹
Your assignment is to build the parser for the μGo language that supports print IO, arithmetic
operations and some basic constructs for μGo. You will have to dene the token classes and the
grammar for μGo using the given Lex and Yacc codes, respectively, to produce the parser. You are
welcome to make any changes of the given codes to meet your expectations. In addition to the
μGo syntax, your produced parser will do simple checking for semantic correctness of the testing
cases.
